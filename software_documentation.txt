"fibonacci_3" is a program written in the Python programming language.

Important functions used in the program are listed below.
1. The function, inputNumber(message) ensures that the user input is strictly a positive integer.
2. The function fib(n) calculates Fibonacci number for the user input fib(n). It was determined to use matrix algebra method to calculate fib(n) for quicker calculation.
3. For quicker validation of primality test, program makes use of the function isPrime(num)
4. Whenever quicker validation by the function isPrime(num) fails, the function rabinMiller(num) is called for deterministic validation.
