 "fibonacci" is a successfully tested program file written in Python programming language. This program needs to be executed on python environment. It was tested on Python 2.7.6 On execution, code expect input from user. On relevent user entry, it displays the output as per the logic mentioned below. But, for multiple user entries, code needs to be re-executed separately.<br />

1. Keyword "Buzz" when Fibonacci number, F(n) is divisible by 3  
2. Keyword "Fizz" when Fibonacci number, F(n) is divisible by 5  
3. Keyword "BuzzFizz" when Fibonacci number, F(n) is a prime number  
4. actual value of F(n), for every other Fibonacci number, F(n)  
<br />
<br />
LIMITATIONS  
Please note that the program takes only positive integer as input. For any other input values, a message "Please enter a positive integer" will be displayed.  
<br />
<br />
